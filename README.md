## **Coursework 1: KGL Data Validation System**

**Focus Areas:** Variables, Data Types, Strings, Booleans, Operators, Conditionals, Arrays

**Estimated Time:** 90-120 minutes

**Total Marks:** 100

### Part A: Variable Declaration and Type Checking (20 marks)

 1. Create a file named kgl_validation.js . Declare the following variables using appropriate
keywords ( let or const ):
     - companyName with the value "Karibu Groceries LTD"
     - minimumTonnage with the value 1000
     - isOperational with the value true
     - managerName (declare but do not assign a value)
     - closedBranches with the value null

 2. Use the typeof operator to check and log the data type of each variable. (5 marks)
 3.  Write comments (single-line and multiline) explaining why you chose let or const for
each variable. (5 marks)

### Part B: String Manipulation and Validation (25 marks)
4. Declare a variable dealerNameInput with the value " james BOND " (note the extra
spaces and inconsistent capitalization).
5. Write code that:
   * Removes the leading and trailing whitespace
   * Converts the cleaned name to proper title case (first letter of each word capitalized)
   * Stores the result in a new variable cleanDealerName
   * Logs the result using a template literal: "Cleaned Dealer Name: [name]" (10 marks)
6. Write a validation check using comparison operators to verify that cleanDealerName :
   * Has a length of not less than 2 characters
   * Is not empty
   * Log "Valid dealer name" or "Invalid dealer name" based on the result (10 marks)
  
### Part C: Conditional Logic and Business Rules (30 marks)
7. Create variables for a procurement record:

    let userRole = 'Sales Agent';<br>
    let procurementTonnage = 1500;<br>
    let produceType = 'Beans';<br>
    let costInUgx = '50000';<br>

8. Implement the following KGL business rules using if...else if...else statements:
    * Rule 1: No sales agent is allowed to record any produce entry. If userRole is 'Sales Agent', log an error message and do NOT proceed with the other checks. (10 marks)
    * Rule 2: For individual dealers, tonnage must be not less than 1000kg. Check if procurementTonnage >= 1000 . (5 marks)
    * Rule 3: The cost must be not less than 5 digits. First convert costInUgx to a Number type, then check if it's >= 10000. (10 marks)
      
9. Use the logical AND ( && ) operator to create a single Boolean expression that checks if BOTH tonnage and cost conditions are met, and log "Procurement record valid" or
"Procurement record invalid". (5 marks)

### Part D: Arrays and Produce Management (25 marks)
10. Create an array named kglProduce containing the five types of produce: ['Beans', 'Grain Maize', 'Cow peas', 'G-nuts', 'Soybeans'] . (5 marks)
11. Write code that:
    * Adds a new produce type "Green Peas" to the end of the array
    * Removes the first item from the array (simulate oldest stock being sold)
    * Checks if "G-nuts" exists in the array using an appropriate array method
    * Logs the final array and its length (15 marks)
      
12. Create a second array branch2Produce with values ['Maize', 'Beans'] . Use the .concat() method to merge kglProduce and branch2Produce into a new array called
allProduce . (5 marks)




## Coursework 2: KGL Inventory Processing System
**Focus Areas:** Loops, Functions, Objects, Date Object<br>
**Estimated Time:** 120-150 minutes,<br>
**Total Marks:** 100
